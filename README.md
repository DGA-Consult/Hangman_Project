# Hangman_Project
A repository for all aspects of the AiCore Hangman Project

The aim of the project is to put together everything I have learned so far in Python. In particular, this project creates a Python version of the Hangman game.

No special licensing or installation instructions.

Script milestone_2.py generates a list of five fruit and selects one of them at random.
Script milestone_3.py: 
  - asks the user to specify a character;
  - checks whether it is a single alphabetical character
  - checks whether the character is indeed in the randomly chosen word.

Script milestone_4.py applied OOP principles to the above tasks:
- creates a hangman class with separate "Ask_for_input" and "check_guess" methods,
- attributes include, word_guessed, num_lives_remaining, list_of_guesses.
